# Application-of-RplidarA2-on-Turtlebot
We use RPLIDAR in the experimental environment with few interferences to collect data of the target, obtain the distance and Angle, and carry out data fusion of the algorithm
This code needs to be used in conjunction with your own RPLidAR filter so that the radar range is only visible to the target. 
Using two very simple functions, you can edit the data and save it to your disk.
